# Tabula-Rasa

Tabula-Rasa (blank slate) was the codename for a project that Johan Wieslander and David HÃ¥kansson had in the spring of 2016 but the project was put on ice after both started university studies in the fall of 2016.

The project was supposed to explore the possibilities of voxel-rendering with the hope of maybe one day turning it into a game. 

All C++ code was written by Johan Wieslander.

Currently no development is done and the repository has therefore been made public.
